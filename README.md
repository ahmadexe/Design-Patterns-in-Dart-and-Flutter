# Design Patterns in Dart and Flutter


## What in the world are design patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are general, proven, and best-practice solutions to the recurring problems that arise in software development.
Design patterns provide a way to communicate between developers and create a common language for software development. They can save time and effort in the design and development of software applications, as they encapsulate solutions that have already been tested and refined.


## Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns are a set of software design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible, efficient and easy to modify.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are a set of software design patterns that deal with the process of object creation and instantiation. They provide ways to create objects in a manner that increases flexibility, reuse, and maintainability.
Creational design patterns typically abstract the process of object creation and encapsulate the details of the creation process. This allows the developer to create objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

## Behavioural Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are a set of software design patterns that describe the interactions between objects and how they work together to accomplish specific tasks. These patterns focus on the communication and collaboration between objects and classes in a system.
